# Open Wi-Finder
## Built for the Esri Canada Center of Excellence 2015 App Challenge

â€”

#### **What it does:** 
*Open Wi-Finder was built to address the existing paucity of information regarding Wi-Fi access in Canadian cities. The application serves two purposes:*
1. On the citizen-facing side of the application, users use their GPS location to either a) find a Wi-Fi hotspot nearby or b) contribute the location of a Wi-Fi hotspot. Each Wi-Fi hotspot will possess attribute information regarding SSID, whether or not it is free, and hours of accessibility. 
2. The Wi-Fi point locations, embedded with the aforementioned information, are available for download on the analytics side of the application. Governments and civic hackers can identify pockets and clusters of Wi-Fi access, overlay census tract data to conduct socioeconomic analyses within these areas, and formulate policies accordingly. 

We hope that Open Wi-Finder will allow for steps to be taken toward mending the digital divide caused by the confluence of cities and ICTs. 

Utilizes:
* [ArcGIS API for Javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
* [CodyHouse Full-Screen Pop-Out Navigation](http://codyhouse.co/gem/full-screen-pop-out-navigation/)
* [Firebase ](https://www.firebase.com) 


Roadmap:
* Further develop analytics functionality.
* Introduce gamification to charter unexplored areas. 
** An objective-based system which rewards users for discovering free Wi-Fi hotspots is currently in the works. Clustering and heatmaps will be used to visualize the flow of hotspots through a city.
